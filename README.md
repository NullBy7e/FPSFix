When you rest at a bonfire, your animation changes to 7710, when that's done and the menu is open, it changes to 7711.
If you reverse hollowing and quit to fast on 60 FPS, your animation get's stuck at 7711.

This tool basically writes an animation of 0 to a specific memory address, effectively kicking you out of the bonfire.
FYI: this only works for the bonfire, there's no way to cheat with this!

Installation:

1. Extract all files to the DATA directory.
2. If using PVP Watchdog: edit DSPWSteam.ini and change *none* on the last line to: FPSFix.dll, otherwise (if not) rename FPSFix.dll to: d3d9.dll.

This tool will need to be updated after every patch release for the game, keep that in mind.
